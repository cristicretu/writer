## Quick summary

As for 2021, this year has been amazing, probably even better than the last one. Most of my wishes, if not all of them,
have been accomplished!! The grind and hard work have been intense, but the rewards and lessons learned are priceless. So, here's a quick
recap of what happened:

Starting the year, I worked at <a href="https://github.com/Landmarks-Tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Landmarks</a> for four months, where
I was able to significantly improve my front-end skills and gained valuable experience collaborating on a team project. A great highlight of the first quarter
was the opportunity to prototype <a href="https://twitter.com/pondorasti/status/1497475655910367234" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new extension</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/pondorasti" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@pondorasti</a>.
This made me play with <a href="https://liveblocks.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">liveblocks</a>, and was amazed by its powers.
In addition to this, I made a <a href="https://wordle.cretu.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">romanian wordle</a> clone, and other small projects like 
<a href="https://github.com/cristicretu/keep-the-streak" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KeepTheStreak</a>. Check out the full list on my <a href="https://github.com/cristicretu?tab=overview&from=2022-01-01&to=2022-01-31" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>.
I also participated in the National Stage of the 2022 National FIRST Competition with the Esentza Robotics team

In addition to High-School, I also took <a href="https://missing.csail.mit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Missing Semester</a>, which further enhanced my technical abilities.
Later, I had the opportunity to work at <a href="https://deta.sh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deta</a>, where I contributed to the development of the new <a href="https://alpha.deta.space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Personal Cloud ‚ú®</a>.
Outside of my professional endeavors, I participated in two summer camps and organized a two-week robotics summer camp alongside my teammates. In my spare time, I also prepared a lot and got my driving license. Toward the end of the year, I ended up purchasing my very own car.

Now over to my favorite section ‚îÄ **les statistiques ‚ú®**.

## Advice

This year gave me probably the most amount of lessons. Here are some of the best recommendations I accumulated:

- If you can't decide, the answer is no
- Take the path more painful in the short term
- To think clearly, and understand the basics. Don't memorize
- Happiness is about the absence of desire, especially the absence of desire for external things
- "A rational person can find peace by cultivating indifference to things outside of their control"
- Put yourself and your work out there every day
- When changing/implementing a new habit, you also have to change your identity based on it
  - You may want more money, but if your identity is someone who consumes rather than creates, then you'll continue to be pulled towards spending rather than earning 
- Design your environment for success
- Be confident, those that are winning, only feel more confident after a win, and those who lose are weak
- **Be friends with people who want the best for you**
- Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today
- The successful people sacrifice.
- Leave your phone on do not disturb all-day
- Spend more time with people who give you energy
- There is no such thing as failure, only failure to learn
- Don‚Äôt take things for granted. Say ‚Äòwow‚Äô and be grateful. 
- **The best investment you can make is to invest in yourself**

This was what I wanted to share about this amazing year - thanks for reading! I hope 2023 will only offer prosperity while everyone will  improve considerably.
